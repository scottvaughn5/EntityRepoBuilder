# Reflection
This is a playful coding exploration I did this morning. I wanted to explore how entity framework might
work under the hood with it's query generation. So I decided to create my own and see what I could
come up with. In this current state there is a lot of cleanup to do but I got it to where I wanted
in the window I allowed myself.
